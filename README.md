<p>This is a url to urn converter script named WebScraber for project FragTrag (https://fragtrag1.upatras.gr/exist/apps/fragtrag/index.html).</p>
<p>This is only a pre-release of the final version and there is more things to be done.</p>
<p>One of the project's main objectives is to describe the algorithm for the creation of urns contained in platform FragTrag.</p>
<p>The script creates on two dimensional array which contains required information for implimenting FragTrag urns. Each extracted link (url) is seperated in seven [7] elements that describe the content to which the link refers.</p>

<p>Moreover an attempt is being done to describe the algorithm behind which the urns are being created trying to build a standardized method</p>
